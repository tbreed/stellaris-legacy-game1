Important events:
- found an alien named Listhima (a Kobarian) on a ruined ship, in exchange for technical assistance she was allowed refuge on Earth. For some unknown reason the people of Earth then elected her president of the UN.

- one alien contact - the Ozkol Republic. They are democratic crusaders, and not currently crowding us, although we are currently occupying the strand of systems linking our respective regions of the galaxy with an eye towards occupying (and militarizing) the crossroads system at the end of the strand.

- discovered signs of a precursor civilization known as "the Yuht," as well as several sites of theirs. Have not explored those sites in earnest.

- there are symbiots of an unknown origin on formerly inhabited planet not far from Sol, and a proposed research project to study them.
